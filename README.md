# T_Breakout
A breakout board for the Adafruit Feather form factor which breaks out the SPI bus into 10 channels each with a unique C/S pin, for the purpose of attaching multiple adafruit MAX31856 breakout to a single feather.


This includes a board design for the breakout board itself, a 3d print file for a holder to mount the populated breakout, as well as a very basic program to gather data from one data pin, which can be easily extended.
